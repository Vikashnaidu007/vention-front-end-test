🌸 Bloom Haven – Interactive Flower Cards

This project was built as part of the Vention Interview Task. The goal was to create interactive product cards using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with no frameworks or external libraries.

✅ Features Implemented

Displays flower product cards with image, title, price, and star rating.
Smooth hover effect: image fades and an “Add to Cart” button appears.
🛒 Add to Cart / Remove from Cart
When added to cart:
A red “In Cart” badge appears on the top-left.
Button changes to “Remove from Cart”.
Clicking Remove reverts the card back to its original state.
Cart count updates in the navbar.
📱 Responsive Design

DOM is dynamically populated using this data.
